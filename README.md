# AI-Gmail-Classifier
This project is an intelligent email automation tool that integrates Google Gmail API with OpenAI's GPT-4o model to classify and respond to emails automatically. It fetches recent emails from the user's Gmail inbox, uses AI to categorize them as urgent, follow-up, or spam, and it drafts appropriate, polite replies using natural language generation.
